My name is Eduardo Car√≠sio. I have the following qualities:

### A little bit about me

I'm a very creative person who loves create processes that help the team's day-to-day life be more productive, avoiding repetitive tasks, enabling focus where it's really needed. I really enjoy working in a team because it allows me to learn different views of the same situation, helping me to see better solutions, but if I don't have a time, it's ok too, I will hunt anything to create üòÅ

So, I started to be a developer early (about 16 years old I guess), and I don't stop any more.
